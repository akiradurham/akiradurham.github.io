                    I am currently a second year Computer Science major pursuing a <br>
                    Data Science minor at the University of Virginia. I currently  <br>
                    work as a Teaching Assistant for Computer Systems and          <br>
                    Organizations 1 where I host office hours, grade assignments   <br>
                    as well as guide students to a better understanding of the     <br>
                    material. I enjoy working on back end projects because it      <br>
                    allows me freedom to optimize and design fully fleshed out     <br>
                    programs where I can focus on functionality. I am on track to  <br>
                    graduate a year early with a bachelor of science in Spring 2025.
